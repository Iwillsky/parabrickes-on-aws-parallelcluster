# Parabricks-on-aws-ParallelCluster
HPC cluster solution for parabricks on aws parallelcluster


This solution presents a method of building Parabricks GPU-cluster on AWS ParallelCluster platform with detailed steps. We provide the demonstration of genomic sample job submission and performance monitoring. Some operation suggestions are also discussed later in this post with consideration to push in production. The infrastructure cost of this hands-on lab is estimated less than $15 based on zero cost of Parabricks trial license, if accomplished in 45 minutes as expected.
